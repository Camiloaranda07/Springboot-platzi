 * Integration tests for CrudMovieEntity - DISABLED
 * 
 * These tests require a full database configuration with H2
 * and proper Spring context setup. The errors indicate that
 * application-test.properties or similar configuration is missing.
 *
 * To enable these tests:
 * 1. Create src/test/resources/application-test.properties
 * 2. Configure H2 database in dependencies
 * 3. Uncomment @DataJpaTest and remove _DISABLED suffix
 *
 * For now, unit tests with Mockito are sufficient for 70% coverage.
